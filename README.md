# GraphQLAssignment

First we create the Apollo server, I used java script.
Just reach to 'graphql-server' folder in Terminal and run the following command - 'npm start'

# Notes - NodeJs should be installed in the system

Now at Apollo Client (Swift Project - GraphQL), Connect with Apollo on the server url which will shown on the terminal after starting of NPM.

For this project the url is 'http://localhost:4000/graphql'
